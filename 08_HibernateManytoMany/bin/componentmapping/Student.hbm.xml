According to the relationship each student should have a unique address.
Since the Student and Address entities are strongly related (composition relation),
 it is better to store them in a single table. 
The relational model is shown below.
The component element is used to map all the Address entity fields to the STUDENT table. 
In Hibernate terms the Address entity is called the component and it cannot have its own primary key,
 it uses the primary key of the enclosing Student entity.

		<meta attribute="class-description">This class contains student details.</meta>
